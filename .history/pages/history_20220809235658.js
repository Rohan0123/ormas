        <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">With changing scenario on Government’s strategies for development program implementation which is based on sustainability of these program and as a process capacitating /involving the grass root institutions/civil societies and having equity and transparency at all levels, ORMAS is being positioned to be working in partnership and as an apex body for knowledge creation, flow and adaptation for creating economic opportunities.

ORMAS has already imbibed a role of facilitator rather than implementer and work in partnerships with other institutions/agencies for sustainability of the initiatives which it started long back. While there has been change in ORMAS’s role, at the same time the role of all partners are being evolved.  ORMAS keep on working more at a systemic level.</p>
